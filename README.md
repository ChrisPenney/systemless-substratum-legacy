## Systemless Substratum (Legacy/Layers Mode)
 A Magisk module which allows installation of Substratum themes in legacy/root mode
systemlessly.

 The new Substratum OMS mode works systemlessly but requires support for it in the ROM.
For the rest, the Legacy mode, which requires root access, normally writes in the
system partition.
 This module aims to provide this functionality via Magisk in a systemless way.
